1. Netlify (Easiest)
Go to Netlify.com and sign up

Drag and drop your .zip file into the Netlify dashboard

Netlify will automatically deploy your site

You can customize the domain in settings

2. Vercel (Great for modern sites)

Click "Import Project" and upload your .zip

Follow the prompts to deploy

3. GitHub Pages (Free hosting)
Create a GitHub account if you don't have one

Create a new repository named yourusername.github.io

Upload all your files (or the unzipped folder contents)

Go to Settings > Pages and enable GitHub Pages

4. Traditional Web Hosting
Purchase hosting (e.g., Bluehost, SiteGround)

Upload your files via FTP or the hosting file manager

Typically upload to the public_html folder

Next Steps After Deployment
Connect a Custom Domain (optional):

Buy a domain (Namecheap, Google Domains)

Point DNS to your hosting provider

Add Analytics:

Add Google Analytics or Plausible tracking

Connect to Real APIs:

Replace the mock data in api.js with real API calls

Consider using:

Amazon/Shopify APIs for deals

Product Hunt API for AI tools

Set Up Auto-Updating:

The auto-update.js will need to be configured with real APIs

Consider using a serverless function (Netlify Functions/AWS Lambda) to fetch data periodically
